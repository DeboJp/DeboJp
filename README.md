  I am student currently pursuing a bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Data  <br><br>
  On a mission to demystify the journey into software development, creating welcoming spaces for newcomers in tech. <br><br>
  Currently, I'm finding ways to enriching my knowledge in AI, in ML/DL, NLP, and CV through courses and hands-on research alike. <br><br>
  Feel free to look around here, I am not usually active here, however, if you find something interesting or want to collaborate feel free to reach out!  :) <br><br>
