  👋 Hello, I am a software engineer currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Data Science. <br><br>
   💡 **About Me:** <br><br>
  On a mission to demystify the journey into software engineering, creating welcoming spaces for newcomers in tech. <br><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; → &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been always interested about the intersection of healthcare and business industries with Comoputer Sciences and now AI. <br><br>
  Currently, I'm finding ways to enrich my knowledge in AI, in ML/DL, NLP, and CV through courses and hands-on research alike. <br><br>
  So far I've been lucky to have gotten experience is **frontend**, **backend**, **databases**, **cloud**, **concurrency** & **distributed systems**, **machine learning(ML)**, **natural language processing(NLP)**, **computer vision(CV)**, some permutations of all of these combined(**fullstack**) and a little bit of **research**.
  
   🔍 **Collaboration?**  <br><br>
  Feel free to look around. I am not usually active here, however, if you find something interesting or want to collaborate feel free to reach out! 🙂 <br><br>
