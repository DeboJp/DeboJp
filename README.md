  🎓 Hello! I am student currently pursuing a bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Data  <br><br>
  👩‍💻 On a mission to demystify the journey into software development, creating welcoming spaces for newcomers in tech. <br><br>
  🚀 Currently, I'm diving deep into the AI wave, enriching my knowledge in AI, particularly RL, and NLP through courses and hands-on research alike. <br><br>
  🎹 Outside the world of code, you'll find me exploring the melodies of the piano or discovering hidden gems in my city.
